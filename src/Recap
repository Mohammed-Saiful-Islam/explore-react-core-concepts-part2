1. You can handle events by passing a function as a prop to an element like <button>.
2. Event handlers must be passed, not called! onClick={handleClick}, not onClick={handleClick()}.
3. You can define an event handler function separately or inline.
4. Event handlers are defined inside a componet, so they can access props.
5. You can declare an event handler in a parent and pass it as a prop to a child.
6. You can define your own event handler props with application-specific names.
7. Explicitly calling an event handler prop from a child handler is good alternative to propagate.
