What exactly is state?
Components often need to change what's on the screen as a resultj of an interaction.
Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking "next" on an image carousel should change whitch image is diplayed, clicking "buy" should put a product in the shopping cart.
Components need to "remember" things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart, In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.
