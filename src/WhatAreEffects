What are Effects?
There are two types of logic inside React components:
Rendering code: lives at the top level of your component. This is where you take the props and state, transform them, and return, the JSX you want to see on the screen.
Event handlers: An event handler might update an input field, submit an HTTP POST request to buy a probuct, or navigate the user to another screen.
Event handlers contain "side effects" (they change the program's state) caused by a specific user action (for example, a button click or typing).
What are Effects?
Consider a ChatRoom component that must connect to the chat server whenever it's visible on the screen.
Sending a message in the chat is an event because it is directly caused by the user clicking a specific button.
However, setting up a server connection is an Effect because it should happen no matter which interaction caused the component to appear.
