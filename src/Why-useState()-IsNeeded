Why useState() is needed:
To update a componet with new data, two things need to happen:
1. Reatain the data between renders.
2. Trigger React to render the component with the new data (re-rendering).
Variables do not preserve data between renders and cannot trigger React to render. Hence, useState is needed as it preserves data since it is a memery as well trigger React to render with the help of setter function.
