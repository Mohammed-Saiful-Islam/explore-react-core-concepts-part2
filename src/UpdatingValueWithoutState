Updating value without state
Here's a component that renders a sculpture image. Clicking the "Next" button should show the next sculpture by changing the index to 1, then 2, and so on. However, this won't work.
Updating value without state
Example code of the previous slide: The handleClick event handler is updating a local variable, index. But two things prevent that change from being visible:
Local variable don't persist btween renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch.
Changes to local variables won't trigger renders. React doesn't realize ti needs to render the component again with the new data.
