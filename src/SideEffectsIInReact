What are side effects in react?
1. Not predictable
2. Actions which are performed with the "outside world"
3. A side effect is performed when we need to reach outside the scope of our current react components to do something.
4. React component rendering and side-effect logic are independent

Some common side effects
1. Making a request to an API  for data from a backend server
2. To interact with browser APIs (that is, to use document or window directly) / Maninpulating DOM directly
3. Using unpredictable timing functions like setTimeout() or setInterval()
4. Reading data from local storage
